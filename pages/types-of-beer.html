                Lager is a type of beer. In Germany, brewing was a winter occupation, and ice was used to keep beer cool during the summer months. 
                Such beer came to be called lager (from German lagern, “to store”). 
                The term lager is today used to denote beer produced from bottom-fermenting yeast.
