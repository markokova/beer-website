                Before 6000 BCE, beer was made from barley in Sumer and Babylonia. Reliefs on Egyptian tombs dating from 2400 BCE show that barley or partly germinated
                barley was crushed, mixed with water, and dried into cakes. When broken up and mixed with water, the cakes gave an extract that was fermented by
                microorganisms accumulated on the surfaces of fermenting vessels.
            </p>
            <p>
                The basic techniques of brewing came to Europe from the Middle East. The Roman historians Pliny and Tacitus (both in the 1st century CE) reported
                that Saxons, Celts, and Nordic and Germanic tribes drank ale. In fact, many of the English terms used in brewing (malt, mash, wort, ale) are Anglo-Saxon
                in origin. During the Middle Ages the monastic orders preserved brewing as a craft. Hops were in use in Germany in the 11th century, and in the
                15th century they were introduced into Britain from Holland. In 1420 beer was made in Germany by a bottom-fermentation process, so called because
                the yeast tended to sink to the bottom of the brewing vessel; before that, the type of yeast used tended to rise to the top of the fermenting product
                and was allowed to overflow or was manually skimmed. Brewing was a winter occupation, and ice was used to keep beer cool during the summer months.
                Such beer came to be called lager (from German lagern, "to store"). The term lager is still used to denote beer produced from bottom-fermenting yeast,
                and the term ale is now used for top-fermented British types of beer.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Industrial Revolution brought the mechanization of brewing. Better control over the process, with the use of the thermometer and saccharometer,
                was developed in Britain and transferred to the Continent, where the development of ice-making and refrigeration equipment in the late 19th century
                enabled lager beers to be brewed in summer. In the 1860s the French chemist Louis Pasteur, through his investigations of fermentation, established many
                of the microbiological practices still used in brewing. The Danish botanist Emile Hansen devised methods for growing yeasts in cultures free of other
                yeasts and bacteria. This pure-culture technology was taken up quickly by Continental lager brewers but not until the 20th century by the ale brewers
                of Britain. Meanwhile, German-style lagers bottom-fermented by pure yeast cultures became dominant in the Americas.

                When and where did beer first originate? It’s difficult to attribute the invention of beer to a particular culture or time period, but the
                world’s first fermented beverages likely emerged alongside the development of grain agriculture some 12,000 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
                As hunter-gatherer tribes settled into agrarian civilizations based around staple crops like wheat, rice, barley and maize,
                they may have also stumbled upon the fermentation process and started brewing beer. Some anthropologists have argued that these early
                peoples’ thirst for a brewed beverage may have contributed to the Neolithic Revolution by inspiring new agricultural technologies.
            </p>

                The earliest known alcoholic beverage may have been brewed around 7000 BCE in China in the village of Jiahu, where neolithic
                pottery shows evidence of a mead-type concoction made from rice, honey and fruit.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first barley beer was most likely born in the Middle East, where hard evidence of beer production dates back about 5,000 years to the
                Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. Not only have archeologists unearthed ceramic vessels from 3400 B.C. still sticky with beer residue,
                but the “Hymn to Ninkasi”—an 1800 B.C. ode to the Sumerian goddess of beer—describes a recipe for a beloved ancient brew made by female priestesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                These nutrient-rich suds were a cornerstone of the Sumerian diet and were likely a safer alternative to drinking water from nearby rivers and
                canals, which were often contaminated by animal waste.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beer consumption also flourished under the Babylonian Empire, where its ancient set of laws, the Code of Hammurabi decreed a daily beer ration
                to citizens. The drink was distributed according to social standing: Laborers received two liters a day, while priests and administrators got five.
                At the time, the drink was always unfiltered, and cloudy, bitter sediment would gather at the bottom of the drinking vessels.
                Special drinking straws were invented to avoid the muck.
            </p>
            <p>
                Few ancient cultures loved their beer as much as the ancient Egyptians. Workers along the Nile were often paid with an allotment of a nutritious,
                sweet brew, and everyone from pharaohs to peasants and even children drank beer as part of their everyday diet. Many of these ancient beers were
                flavored with unusual additives such as mandrake, dates and olive oil.
            </p>

            <p>
                More modern-tasting libations would not arrive until the Middle Ages when Christian monks and other artisans began brewing beers seasoned with hops.
