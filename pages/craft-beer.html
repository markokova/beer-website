        <h2>Craft Brewer Definition</h2>
        
        <article>
            <p>According to Brewers Association a brewer is considered a craft brewer if the two criteria mentioned bellow are satisfied.</p>
            <h3>Small</h3>
            <p>Annual production of 6 million barrels of beer or less (approximately 3 percent of U.S. annual sales). Beer production is attributed
            to a brewer according to rules of alternating proprietorships.</p>
            <h3>Independent</h3>
            <p>
                Less than 25 percent of the craft brewery is owned or controlled (or equivalent economic interest) by a beverage alcohol industry 
                member that is not itself a craft brewer.
            </p>
            <p>

            <ul>

                </li>
                <li>
                    The hallmark of craft beer and craft brewers is innovation. Craft brewers interpret historic styles with unique twists and develop new styles that have no precedent
                </li>
                <li>
                    Craft beer is generally made with traditional ingredients like malted barley; interesting and sometimes non-traditional ingredients are often added for distinctiveness
                </li>
                <li>
                    Craft brewers have distinctive, individualistic approaches to connecting with their customers
                </li>
                <li>
                    Craft brewers maintain integrity by what they brew and their general independence, free from a substantial interest by a non-craft brewer
                </li>
